    "Project Title: Investigating Trends and Risk Factors in Aircraft Incidents<br>\n",
    "Team Members: Asael Horne, Soumya Chava, Monica Regulagadda<br>\n",
    "E-mail Addresses: asael.horne@utah.edu, u1538585@utah.edu, u1504835@utah.edu UIDs: u1165839, u1538585, u1504835<br>\n",

    "# Background and Motivation\n",
    "Aviation incidents remain a crucial area of study, as understanding their causes can lead to significant improvements in safety protocols, regulatory policies, and technology. Aircraft accidents and malfunctions not only pose risks to human life but also have economic and operational consequences. By analyzing historical incident data, we can identify key patterns that contribute to incidents and develop insights that may help reduce future occurrences.\n",
    "Our interest in this topic stems from both academic curiosity and the presented opportunity to apply our skills of data science. Through this project, we aim to supply data-driven insights that explore trends in aviation incidents and identify key factors contributing to their occurrence. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Objectives\n",
    "This project seeks to analyze aircraft incident data and answer the following questions:<br>\n",
    "1.\tHow does the number of aircraft incidents vary by year or month?<br>\n",
    "2.\tWhat are the most common causes of aircraft incidents, and how frequently do they occur?<br>\n",
    "3.\tIs there a correlation between weather conditions (wind speed, visibility, precipitation) along with the age of aircraft and aircraft incidents?<br>\n",
    "4.\tDo more incidents occur during certain lighting conditions (e.g., daytime vs. nighttime)?<br>\n",
    "5.\t How does altitude affect the likelihood of incidents?<br>\n",
    "6.\tWhich phases of flight (takeoff, cruise, landing) have the highest number of incidents?<br>\n",
    "7.\tWhere are the most frequent aircraft incidents located, and are there geographic patterns in crash occurrences?<br>\n",
    "8.\tHow does the amount of fuel on board affect the likelihood and severity of aircraft incidents?<br>\n",
    "9.\tWhat percentage of injuries are fatal?<br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "By addressing these questions, we hope to:<br>\n",
    "•\tIdentify patterns and trends in aviation incidents over time.<br>\n",
    "•\tUnderstand the role of environmental factors, such as weather and lighting conditions, in aviation incidents.<br>\n",
    "•\tEvaluate the impact of operational factors like aircraft age and altitude on incident likelihood.<br>\n",
    "•\tProvide data-driven insights that could inform aviation safety policies and preventive measures.<br>\n",
    "•\tApply data science techniques, including statistical analysis, correlation analysis, and machine learning, to extract meaningful insights from aviation data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description and Acquisition\n",
    "The dataset for this study is obtained from the government (Courtesy: National Transportation Safety Board) aviation safety database. The dataset consists of structured records with attributes such as:<br>\n",
    "•\tIncident Details: Date, time, location, and event type.<br>\n",
    "•\tWeather Conditions: Wind speed, visibility, precipitation, temperature.<br>\n",
    "•\tAircraft Information: Manufacturer, model, year of manufacture, registration details.<br>\n",
    "•\tFlight Phases: Takeoff, cruise, landing.<br>\n",
    "•\tInjury Data: Severity and number of injuries or fatalities.<br>\n",
    "The data is available for download from the official government source at the NTSB website. The files available for download are Microsoft Access Database files, with more than 100,000 entries and more than 200 attributes. No web scraping or API access restrictions are involved, ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "# Ethical Considerations\n",
    "Ethical concerns include:<br>\n",
    "•\tEnsuring responsible use of aviation incident data without misrepresenting findings.<br>\n",
    "•\tAvoiding misleading conclusions that might unfairly attribute blame to individuals, airlines, or aircraft manufacturers without sufficient evidence.<br>\n",
    "•\tEnsuring compliance with data privacy and ethical research guidelines.<br>\n",
    "•\tDepending on results, students may be less likely to fly, causing a decrease in revenue for aviation companies. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Cleaning and Processing\n",
    "To ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis, we will do a substantial amount of cleaning and processing. We will do some feature engineering like the following:<br>\n",
    "•\tHandling missing data: Using imputation techniques for missing values.<br>\n",
    "•\tData normalization: Standardizing categorical and numerical data.<br>\n",
    "•\tRemoving inconsistencies: Identifying and eliminating duplicate or incorrect records.<br>\n",
    "The attributes that we will be extracting are ev_date, ev_time, latitude, longitude, mid_air, on_ground_collision, ligt_cond, sky_ceil_ht, wind_vel_kts, gust_kt, altimeter, wx_int_precip, fuel_on_board, acft_model, acft_make, damage, Altitude, inj_person_count, and finding_description.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "To gain initial insights into the dataset, we will use:<br>\n",
    "•\tTime-series analysis to track trends in aviation incidents.<br>\n",
    "•\tBar charts and pie charts to visualize the most common causes of incidents.<br>\n",
    "•\tCorrelation matrices and scatter plots to analyze relationships between weather conditions, aircraft age and incident occurrence.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis Methodology\n",
    "The project will employ:<br>\n",
    "1.\tDescriptive Statistics: Box plots, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots will be used to summarize and visualize key patterns in the data.<br>\n",
    "2.\tCorrelation Analysis: T-tests and ANOVA tests will be used to explore relationships between different factors (e.g., weather, age and incident frequency).<br>\n",
    "3.\tRegression Models: Linear regression models built using the Ordinary Least Squares method will be used to determine the impact of aircraft age, weather, and altitude on incident likelihood.<br>\n",
    "4.\tChi-squared Tests: Chi-squared tests will be used to assess differences in categorical variables like flight phase, lighting conditions, and variables that violate basic assumptions of ANOVA and t-tests.<br>\n",
    "5.\tMachine Learning Models: Basic unsupervised clustering models will help to predict high-risk conditions based on historical data.<br>\n",
